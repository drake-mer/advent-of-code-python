# Thought process
# What are we discussing ??
"""
1. Monkeys
2. Yelling
3. Operations and Math, that's the core business

Let's find some vocabulary to match these ideas ??

First question -> should we assimilate a value and an operation to the same basic type?
Let say no, let's create a 'value' type.

Let's use a dataclass to describe an operation

--> now we get some problem: parsing; is this is in the domain model?
--> No, it's a generic problem, of the kind extract-transform-load. Let's solve it apart

But problem, the problem space does not deal with values only, but with references. OMG !!!

How are we going to deal with that? Let's use a union type.

Also, how about the Callable? It's not any callable, it's basically +*-/. Maybe an enum is better in this case?

And maybe we need to use some fancy pattern matching to find the right op?

Ok, it's almost done. Notice that so fare we didn't even try to address the real problem, we just defined
names, convenient types for the problem in the most descriptive way possible. Instead of focusing on the HOW?
We focus on the WHAT
In some sense, DDD is close to functional programming in the sense that we have a descriptive approach
We tell the computer how the solution looks like before even thinking of an algorithm to solve the problem.

It's also akin to what Einstein said: a problem well posed is 50% of the solution. Anyway let's continue on our
monkey business.

At this point, we think that the parsing is correct and that the model is correct for the domain we are trying to solve.
It remains some kind of ambiguity. We know that this problem is typical of lazy loading of values and that we can probably
come with an elegant way to solve it. Will we manage to derive an elegant solution from this?

HO NO! Domain Model changed! Instead of computing operations, we need to solve an equation! That's so painful! How
can we carry over with this?

Stick to your DDD approach dude! It will help you find clarity in this mess!

OK!

So now, we have a pretty clear overview of the domain. We basically have a tree of operation, but we need
to invert the whole tree to find exactly what number put with the ref 'humn' So we will probably need to invert
a large equation looking like

1234 = (456 + (2 * (6 // (123 + (... ( 123 * humn))))))

So we need a way to invert operation, that's a lot of thinking. HO NO \o/

More domain model knowledge to invest, that's *DIFFICULT* and Math is *HARD*

Let's try anyway

Let's call 'S' the symbolic operation to carry

Let's call 'N' the actual number we know in the OP

Let's call 'I' the number we know we are looking for.
